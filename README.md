# OpenXLA PJRT Plugin

This repository contains an experimental PJRT plugin library which can bridge
Jax (and TensorFlow in the future) to OpenXLA/IREE.

# Developing

Support for dynamically loaded PJRT plugins is brand new as of 12/21/2022 and
there are sharp edges still. The following procedure is being used to develop.

There are multiple development workflows, ranked from easiest to hardest (but
most powerful).

## Setup options

The below presumes that you have a compatible Jax/Jaxlib installed. Since
PJRT plugin support is moving fast, it is rare that released versions are
appropriate. **See ["Building Jax from Source"](#building-jax-from-source)
below.**

If you are building without CUDA, you may still need to install IREE's CUDA deps
for the `bazel` build below:

```shell
export IREE_CUDA_DEPS_DIR=${HOME?}/.iree_cuda_deps
../iree/build_tools/docker/context/fetch_cuda_deps.sh ${IREE_CUDA_DEPS_DIR?}
```

### Option 1: Synchronize to a nightly IREE release

```shell
python ./sync_deps.py
python -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt
python ./configure.py --cc=clang --cxx=clang++ --cuda-sdk-dir=$CUDA_SDK_DIR

# Source environment variables to run interactively.
# The above generates a .env and .env.sh file with key setup vars.
source .env.sh

# Build.
bazel build iree/integrations/pjrt/...

# Run a sample.
JAX_PLATFORMS=iree_cpu python test/test_simple.py
JAX_PLATFORMS=iree_cuda python test/test_simple.py
# When multiple CUDA devices are installed, pick one by setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<n>.
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 JAX_PLATFORMS=iree_cuda python test/test_simple.py

```

### Option 2: Set up for a full at-head dev rig

```
mkdir openxla
cd openxla
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate || die "Could not activate venv"

pip install git+https://github.com/openxla/openxla-devtools.git
openxla-workspace init
openxla-workspace checkout --sync openxla-pjrt-plugin

cd jax
pip install numpy wheel
python build/build.py \
    --bazel_options=--override_repository=xla=$PWD/../xla \
      --enable_tpu && pip3 install dist/*.whl --force-reinstall
pip install -e .

cd ../iree
cmake -GNinja -B ../iree-build/ -S . \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
    -DIREE_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
    -DIREE_ENABLE_LLD=ON -DIREE_ENABLE_CCACHE=ON
cd ../iree-build
ninja libIREECompiler.so
export DYLIB_PATH=$PWD

cd ../openxla-pjrt-plugin
python ./configure.py --cc=clang --cxx=clang++ --iree-compiler-dylib=$DYLIB_PATH/lib/libIREECompiler.so
source .env.sh
bazel build iree/integrations/pjrt/cpu/...

# Do simple smoke test.
JAX_PLATFORMS=iree_cpu python test/test_simple.py
```

## Building Jax from Source

Install Jax with Python sources:

```shell
# Starting in the openxla-pjrt-plugin repo, download JAX and sync to a
# compatible commit.
python ./sync_deps.py
python -m pip install -e ../jax
```

Build a compatible jaxlib:

```shell
# Currently pluggable PJRT is commingled with TPU support... folks are
# working on it :/
cd ../jax
# NOTE: Try running `bazel clean --expunge` if you run into undeclared inclusion
# error(s).
python build/build.py \
  --bazel_options=--override_repository=xla=$PWD/../xla \
  --enable_tpu
# Install the version of jaxlib you just built.
python -m pip install dist/*.whl --force-reinstall
```

## Generating runtime traces

The plugins can be build with tracing enabled by adding the bazel build flag
`--iree_enable_runtime_tracing`. With this flag, if a profiler is running,
instrumentation will be sent to it. It can be useful to set the environment
variable `TRACY_NO_EXIT=1` in order to block termination of one-shot programs
that exit too quickly to stream all events.

## Generating compile_commands.json

`compile_commands.json` can be generated by the following command.

```
bazel run @hedron_compile_commands//:refresh_all
```


## ASAN

Developing with ASAN is recommended but requires some special steps because
we need to arrange for the plugin to be able to link with undefined
symbols and load the ASAN runtime library.

* Edit out the `"-Wl,--no-undefined"` from `build_defs.bzl`
* Set env var `LD_PRELOAD=$(clang-12 -print-file-name=libclang_rt.asan-x86_64.so)`
  (assuming compiling with `clang-12`. See configured.bazelrc in the IREE repo).
* Set env var `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0` (Python allocates a bunch of stuff
  that it never frees. TODO: Make this more fine-grained so we can detect leaks in
  plugin code).
* `--config=asan`

This can be improved and made more systematic but should work.

## Running the Jax test suite

The JAX test suite can be run with pytest. We recommend using `pytest-xdist`
as it spawns tests in workers which can be restarted in the event of individual
test case crashes.

Setup:

```
# Install pytest
pip install pytest pytest-xdist

# Install the ctstools package from this repo (`-e` makes it editable).
pip install -e ctstools
```

Example of running tests:

```
JAX_PLATFORMS=iree_cuda pytest -n4 --max-worker-restart=9999 \
  -p openxla_pjrt_artifacts --openxla-pjrt-artifact-dir=/tmp/foobar \
  ~/src/jax/tests/nn_test.py
```

Note that you will typically want a small number of workers (`-n4` above) for
CUDA and a larger number can be tolerated for cpu.

The plugin `openxla_pjrt_artifacts` is in the `ctstools` directory and
performs additional manipulation of the environment in order to save
compilation artifacts, reproducers, etc.
